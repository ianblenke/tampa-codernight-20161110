# Challenge: Levenshtein Distance

Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance of 1.
That is, you can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y.

A word’s social network consists of all of its friends, plus all of their friends, and all of their friends’ friends, and so on.

Write a program to tell us how big the social network for the given word is, using our word list.
